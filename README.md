# Esport Tracker
This project was a personal endeavor born out of my long-standing passion for the Call of Duty League (CDL). Inspired by my deep involvement in the CDL scene, I conceptualized and created a website that empowers users to access a wealth of information. Upon logging in, users can explore the latest news, browse teams, view match schedules, discover player profiles, and delve into comprehensive details about their favorite team.
